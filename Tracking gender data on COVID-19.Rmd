## Introduction

In this blog, we summarize the existing data on sex-disaggregated COVID-19 cases and deaths from [Global Health 50/50](https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/the-data-tracker/) and ask how complete our picture is when compared to all reported cases and deaths. In addition, we examine the shares of COVID-19 cases and deaths that are sex-disaggregated by income and region.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
